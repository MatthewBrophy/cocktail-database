### Welcome to the Cocktail Database!
We are proud to present our final project for Flatiron School Module 1.  Below you will find the details for our project as well as instructions for how to run the application on your local machine.

### Project Details
For this project we built a fully-functional cocktail searching database using the api hosted at https://www.thecocktaildb.com.  We used the data provided by the api to seed our database, and then operated on our database to perform various tasks for the end-user. Using our application a user can:
1. Learn how to make a cocktail by searching by the cocktail name.  The return includes all ingredients and measurements as well as instructions for creating the selected drink.
2. Look up a list of all drinks that can be made with an ingredient and then find instructions for how to make any drink on the list.
3. Look up the decription of any ingredient.
4. Get a list of 10 random drinks and then select one to view the instructions for how to make it.

### Install Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. In the parent directory of the cloned repository run `bundle install` to install the required Ruby Gems.
3. In the same directory run `ruby bin/run.db` to start the application.
